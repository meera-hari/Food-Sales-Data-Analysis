# Food-Sales-Data-Analysis-Performed cleaning, exploring and creating a dashboard on the Food Sales Data of an E-commerce organization.
Here a dataset of over 65000 sales records of different food products, with their different prices and quantity is available.
The main requirement of the business enterprise is to determine the Sales trend over the years, months, recognize the most profitable products and loss making products, identify the customer spending profile.
The data cleaning has been done using SQL queries on MS SQL Server and the file has been attached with thie repository.
The cleaned Data has been then imported into Power BI for further insights gathering and creating a visual dashboard for the stakeholders.
The Power BI Dashboard has also been attatched with this file.
The Power BI results have been further validated using SQL for accuracy.
Thank You!
