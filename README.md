# Food Sales Analysis

Sales management has gained importance to meet increasing competition and the need
for improved methods of distribution to reduce cost and to increase profits. Sales
management today is the most important function in a commercial and business
enterprise.  
In this project we will be trying to analyze a food sales dataset with over 65000 records and understand the Sales trend across time, identifying the commodities that are in demand and also giving the stakeholder visual reports to understand all the insights that we gain from the dataset and come up with better decisions to improve the sales model.

1.	Product Perspective & Problem Statement

The objective for this project is to design a Sales dashboard to analyze the sales based on various product categories. The company wants to add user control for product category, so users can select a category and can see the trend month-wise and product-wise accordingly. The Analytics team also wants to get a clear idea of the products that make profit or loss and also showcase the consumer behavior.

2. 	Tools used
•	SQL – for Data cleaning and Data Validation
•	Power BI – for Data Visualization

3. Process followed  
• Checking for null values and removing them using SQL  
•	Checking for outliers and handling them using SQL   
•	Removing unnecessary fields from the dataset using SQL   
•	Formation of separate measures table for easier checking in Power BI  
•	Formation of Calendar table for achieving a continous time series graph for Sales trend  
•	Use of charts and cards for proper visualization of facts in Power BI  
•	Use of navigation between dashboard pages for smooth gliding from insight to insight  
•	Validation of the Power BI insights using SQL for accuracy  

4. End Result
i) A visual dashboard highlighting the Sales trend of the Products over a time period has been shown. 

ii) The dashboard also provides insights on the Product consumption highlighting the profit making and loss making products. 

iii) For the stakeholders to get a better idea, we have added the user control options on understanding the Product trend over time.  

iv) A general individual consumer behavior is also showcased in the dashboard. 
 
v) To solve any additional queries that the stakeholder may have, an AI generated Question-Answer format is also added to the Dashboard.
